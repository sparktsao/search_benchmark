Purchasers of the EverQuest II Collector's Edition received a soundtrack CD as part of the package. The expansions, Echoes of Faydwer and Rise of Kunark, included many themes from the corresponding zones in the original EverQuest, arranged by Inon Zur.\nIt features characters and locations from the original that have been altered by centuries of war and cataclysmic destruction. While the title did receive favorable reviews upon release, it was notably less influential to the genre than the previous installment, and it faced heavy competition from other MMORPGs, such as World of Warcraft, which was released two weeks after EverQuest II.\nThe EverQuest II feature set has expanded since its release in 2004. Players must choose a 'race' when creating a character. The choice of races include human, barbarian, dwarf, erudite, ogre, iksar, troll, gnome, half elf, high elf, halfling, Vah Shir, wood elf and dark elf (which were available in the original EverQuest) along with new options such as the Kerra (a cat-person similar to the Vah Shir of the original EverQuest), the Ratonga (a rat-like people), the Sarnak (a dragon-like people) and the Fae and Arasai (fairy-like people).\nEverQuest II is a 3D fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) originally developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment for Microsoft Windows PCs and released in November 2004.

Zero Dawn would give humanity a second chance, but it was also up to Firebreak to prevent the world's upheaval in the meantime, so the facility was left running. At the behest of Anita Sandoval, the project's lead programmer, the project's director Kenny Chau put CYAN into hibernation and powered down the facility to mask its energy signature from the marauding robots in preparation for the inevitability of the Yellowstone area being overrun. Teaming up with Ourea and her brother, the Banuk chieftain Aratak, they entered the Firebreak facility and purged CYAN of HEPHAESTUS's control.

CYAN was created in the mid-21st century by Anita Sandoval, the lead programmer of Project Firebreak, an underground complex built to stabilize the Yellowstone Caldera and prevent it from erupting.\nFive years before the events of The Frozen Wilds, CYAN unexpectedly received a direct network connection request from what she thought were humans more advanced than the surrounding tribes. Eager to connect with technologically advanced humans, CYAN accepted the request, only to be immediately bombarded with a flood of malicious code. The request had in fact come from HEPHAESTUS, which sought to commandeer the Firebreak facility to build and operate a research and development cauldron at its location.\nAfter reactivating, CYAN spent centuries in total isolation, unaware of what had happened or what the state of the world was beyond her facility's walls. She passed the time optimizing Firebreak's functions and solving Gaussian integer problems, but she was saddened by her solitude.[6]\nYear later, thanks to Ourea eventually enlisting the help of her brother Aratak and the formidable Nora Seeker Aloy, HEPHAESTUS's control over CYAN was purged and its control over the Firebreak facility was cleared. Unfortunately, this cost Ourea her life, much to CYAN's sorrow.""), LinkupSearchTextResult(type='text', name='Project Firebreak | Horizon Wiki | Fandom', url='https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Firebreak', content=""At the behest of Anita Sandoval, the project's lead programmer, the project's director Kenny Chau put CYAN into hibernation and powered down the facility to mask its energy signature from the marauding robots in preparation for the inevitability of the Yellowstone area being overrun.\nProject Firebreak was a top-secret environmental protection project designed to stabilize the Yellowstone Caldera beneath the mountains of what was once Wyoming in North America. It is overseen and maintained by an AI called CYAN. The ruins of its facility, now called Thunder's Drum by the local Banuk, serve as a location in Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds.\nZero Dawn would give humanity a second chance, but it was also up to Firebreak to prevent the world's upheaval in the meantime, so the facility was left running. At the behest of Anita Sandoval, the project's lead programmer, the project's director Kenny Chau put CYAN into hibernation and powered down the facility to mask its energy signature from the marauding robots in preparation for the inevitability of the Yellowstone area being overrun.\nCYAN's final human contact was with Chau, after which Firebreak was left untouched for centuries. The AI HEPHAESTUS, formerly the GAIA subroutine responsible for designing the machines that Zero Dawn used to terraform the planet back to being able to sustain life, had judged the human species to be a threat due to human hunting of machines.\nThe solution came in the form of Project Firebreak. With Faro Automated Solutions' head Ted Faro providing funding and resources, and renowned scientist Elisabet Sobeck innovating the technology, the construction of a sprawling underground complex began. Utilizing special technologies, overseen and managed by a highly advanced artificial intelligence know as the Caldera of Yellowstone Analytic Nexus (CYAN), the project aimed at controlling the volcanic activity of the Yellowstone Caldera."")]","{""final_conclusion"":{""correct_models"":[""A"",""C"",""D"",""E""],""justification"":""Models A, C, D, and E all correctly identified Anita Sandoval as the lead programmer of Project Firebreak who helped create CYAN in Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds.

Unlike your Hearthstone it cannot be used in combat, but being a spell it benefits from haste and will thus be slightly faster than using a Hearthstone if you have any haste on your gear.

Content: The Cleric is a good class for beginners and intermediate players or those seeking a warrior that relies on Strength and Faith, as it starts at a low level which allows for greater customization, yet already has a good stat distribution focused on Strength and Faith (and with another spell slot available upon the investment of one more point in Attunement). The Deprived can be considered the professional class, as its terrible lineup of starting equipment makes the beginning stages of the game much harder to get through until you find better weapons and armor.

Content: Still, it doesn't hurt to be informed when it comes to the many classes players can choose in _Dark Souls_ and how it can aid them in taking out enemies early on and pursuing the build of their choice. Even a class like the Deprived is viable in the game — in fact, veterans consider it to be **_Dark Souls'_ best class** since it allows for the highest level of freedom when trying to form a final build! The **Cleric** is the best class for people who want the right mix of faith and strength in their build, primarily because the healing miracles will be super handy to almost every player since recovering is important in the unforgiving world of _Dark Souls._ Image 35: dark souls 2011 game enemies","In the video game Dark Souls 1 for the PlayStation 3, the Hunter class starts at Soul Level 6.","[""https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Classes_(Dark_Souls)"",""https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Classes""]","For other uses, see Classes (disambiguation).

Posted by u/jasno - 102 votes and 106 comments Personally I think it is a win/win, some people don't have much time to play but they want to try Hardcore even though they totally expect to die, now they can try Hardcore and even if they die they still have an actual character to show for their time invested, although the character will just be on a normal realm.","{""final_conclusion"":{""correct_models"":[""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"",""E""],""justification"":""All five models provided the correct release date for World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore official servers, which is August 24, 2023.

Let’s explore it.\nWhen the elevator starts moving again, Miles successfully pushes Trager out. He attempts one final lunge, but his torso gets crushed while the elevator moves between floors, which instantly kills him. His shears also fall through the slit in front of the door, predictably preventing us from arming ourselves. Still, this was a cathartic victory, one of precious few Outlast gifts us.\nAnd if any of its villains earned such a painful death, it’s Trager. Anyway, we jump out of the elevator’s escape hatch and ultimately end up in the cafeteria, which a somber Variant has lit ablaze. That’s another memorable set piece, one elevated by one of Mount Massive’s most sympathetic inmates. If you record it with your camera, Miles notes how this man is choosing to violently burn to death “rather than stay in this place.” And then all the momentum Outlast was building comes to a screeching halt as it regresses.\nOutlast’s opening chapter is a serviceable introduction to the macabre setting. You’ll swiftly learn all the main gameplay mechanics: running, jumping, climbing, hiding, finding collectibles, and using your camera.

Content: When I was playing back in middle school, Rogue wasn’t even a class, it was Thief and it was at times convoluted, but I’ve always loved it because there’s something about the class that makes you feel like you need to be quicker and smarter than everyone else if you want to succeed. The Sorcerer class is always a lot of fun, and what it lacks in overall power compared to the Wizard class, it more than makes up for in getting to laugh at said class and say “Haha, you had to read books for ten years to use magic and I can just, like, do it.” In all seriousness, Sorcerer isn’t just a weaker, though cooler Wizard, it uses Metamagic, which is a feature that can bring a lot of versatility to your game.

After those features, players have to wait until level 14 to receive a few helpful options from the Revelation in Flesh ability, which is too little too late. It provides plenty of flexibility when it comes to damage types, plus the ability to remotely cast spells through the Manifest Mind feature, which creates a sensor in the form of a sentient book. It also provides a powerful option for scouting, as its spectral tome can move up to 300 feet away from you.

The following seeds can be used to generate a Celebrationmk10 world (case-insensitive): Please update this page for 1.4.4 additions The spawn point can be on the left or right edge of the world, implying most of the spawns usually happening in the inner third of the world will happen in the left or right sixth of the world.

Celebrationmk10 is a secret world seed introduced in the 1.4.2.3 update. Due to the fact that the Steampunker spawns right from the start of the game in Celebrationmk10 worlds, it is possible to buy the Jetpack, a post-Mechanical Boss wing before a single boss has been defeated. Due to the way Celebrationmk10 seed is implemented, the list is not exhaustive and any number of 0 can be added before the number seed. Note that invasion events like Goblin Army will take place near the initial spawn point or Town NPCs, so in Celebrationmk10 worlds they will take place at the Ocean which the player spawned at by default. Since this seed increases certain drop rates, items in chests spawn with the best modifier, and NPCs sell more items, this is a very good seed for World farming and finding rare items.","{""integrated_concise_answer"":""The secret world seed 'Celebrationmk10' was added in Terraria patch 1.4.2.3 on May 16, 2021, in celebration of Terraria's 10th anniversary."",""final_conclusion"":{""correct_models"":[""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"",""E""],""justification"":""All models correctly identified that the 'Celebrationmk10' seed was added in the Terraria 1.4.2.3 update.

Content: The nice table at the beginning of the class that shows features and spell slots per spell level now doesn’t just show spell slots per level. When a creature within 60 feet of you (and that you can see) succeeds on an Ability Check (not d20 Test, pay attention please) or an Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction, roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the result from the creature’s roll. What I like here is that you can use spell slots lower than level 3, with the drawback that damage is reduced by 1d8 for each level below level 3. It’s the action you take when you want to cast a spell or use a magic item that requires an Action.

Content: It grants +1 Str, a Bonus Action attack when you crit or drop an enemy to 0 hp (do you know, I had forgotten that the original triggered on a crit, because the Barbarian in my game who has this Feat crits so rarely… sorry, buddy), and instead of the -5 to hit/+10 damage of the original, you now add your PB to the damage you deal on a hit, 1/turn. Because there isn’t a way to use your Action to Escape before the end of your turn (short of Shoving or casting a Spell that Incapacitates or pushes the enemy), you’re quite likely to break out by succeeding your Saving Throw, then immediately get Grappled again when the attacker hits you.

Warrior | Dark Souls 2 Wiki
https://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Warrior - Warrior is a class in Dark Souls II. Warrior starting items, stats, strategies and playstyle for DKS and Dark Souls Remastered. Warrior in Dark Souls II is a Starting Class. The Warrior is meant for players who prefer high damage and slow-paced classes. It starts with a Broken Straight Sword and an Iron Parma as its starting weapons. The Starting Classes of Dark Souls II will only give you a head start on certain stats.\nThere is some nuance to this class because while it may start with a bad weapon but if you get your hands on the morning star in Majula or get lucky with a petrified something you should be pretty set for the early game.

I started with the warrior, wasn't that hard, found the falchion, started to max intelligence, soul greatsword, and falchion +10.\nWhile Strength and Dexterity will give you decent close-range damage when leveled. Here's what you can base your starting points on, and what you can possibly end up with as you progress: Notes: A well-balanced class, their decent armor and shield make them a solid choice for complete beginners. For a game where defending is so important, having just one class that starts with a shield bad.

Warrior | Dark Souls Wiki
https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/warrior - Warrior is a starting Class in Dark Souls II. The Warrior is meant for players who prefer high damage and slow-paced classes. It starts with a Longsword and an Iron Parma as its starting offensive and defensive equipment.\nThere is some nuance to this class because while it may start with a bad weapon but if you get your hands on the morning star in Majula or a petrified something you should be pretty set for the early game.

Warrior (Dark Souls II) | Dark Souls Wiki | Fandom
https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Warrior_(Dark_Souls_II) - The Warrior is one of the classes in Dark Souls II. It has the highest starting Strength and notably above-average Dexterity, making it well-suited for builds that want to focus on Strength-based weapons with moderate Dexterity requirements or use weapons that scale well with both stats. This is also the only class in Dark Souls II to start out with a shield, the Iron Parma.

Warrior | Dark Souls II Wiki
http://darksouls2.wikidot.com/warrior - The Warrior's Iron Parma is a reliable shield boasting high stability and physical block for its class. The Broken Straight Sword, on the other hand, should be replaced immediately. Once you reach Majula, you can pick up the Morning Star there as a better starting weapon. The Warrior's low Agility means they initially have only 5 invincibility frames at the start of their roll versus 13 i-frames on a Dark Souls 1/3 fast roll.","{""final_conclusion"":{""correct_models"":[""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"",""E""],""justification"":""All models (A, B, C, D, and E) provided the correct answer, 'Iron Parma,' for the shield that the Warrior starting class in Dark Souls II starts with, as confirmed by the reference sources provided.""},""analysis"":{""common"":""All models correctly identified 'Iron Parma' as the shield for the Warrior starting class in Dark Souls II."",""unique_to_model_A"":"""",""unique_to_model_B"":"""",""unique_to_model_C"":"""",""unique_to_model_D"":"""",""model_A_strengths"":""Clear and accurate response with citations."",""model_A_weaknesses"":""No visible weaknesses."",""model_B_strengths"":""Clear, accurate, and concise response."",""model_B_weaknesses"":""Lack of cited sources."",""model_C_strengths"":""Clear and accurate response with citations."",""model_C_weaknesses"":""No visible weaknesses."",""model_D_strengths"":""Clear and accurate response with citations."",""model_D_weaknesses"":""No visible weaknesses.""},""improvement_recommendations"":{""for_model_A"":""Maintain the current level of accuracy and clear citations."",""for_model_B"":""Include citations to enhance credibility."",""for_model_C"":""Maintain the current level of accuracy and clear citations."",""for_model_D"":""Maintain the current level of accuracy and clear citations.""}}","[""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"",""E""]"

Demonic eredar also appear to refer to themselves as ""man'ari"", and usage of it as a species name to refer to the eredar of the Burning Legion can be considered grammatically correct as Kil'jaeden appropriated the term for his own use, though the man'ari mostly refer to themselves simply as ""eredar"".
